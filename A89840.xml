         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>How ſin is ſtrengthned, and how it is overcome.</head>
            <p>THat Sin is in the world, and that all are thereby become children
of wrath, is generally believed and confeſſed by all; but how ſin is
ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in men and women againſt God and their own ſouls, or how it
is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, few there be that have learned or minde to know; yet for their
ſakes that doth, I do here declare ſomwhat of that which I have received
from him, who is faithful and true in all his teſtimony.</p>
            <p>And this I finde, that as ſin got rooting at firſt through
luſt, ſo till this day it hath its ſtrength, by the deſires going forth
to affect or luſt after ſomthing whether ſpiritual, or carnal, above,
before, or beſides what that eternal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by which man was created, doth
communicate to him, or beget in him; for the eye of the Lilly being blinded by
the god of this world, which eye ſhould look unto God for all; there is an
eye of unbelief open, which looks into the viſibles, and gives occaſion for
the luſt to conceive in the mind, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and deſires, after
ſomething which the ſpirit of God leads not to, for the obtaining whereof
all the power and wiſdom that is in man is ſet on work, and this becomes
ſin both in the deſires and actions, and the more it is followed, the
ſtronger it is; for what ever is hereby obtained, becomes a treaſure of
wickedneſs, laid up in the habitation of the wicked one, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the luſt
is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>creaſed, and the
ſeed of God burthened and buried, whereby the creature becomes daylie more
unſenſible of the will of God, and the movings of that pure ſpirit which
ſhould keep the creature alive to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and draw the mind wholly up
to the Father, on him alone to wait for a ſupply in all things, both for
ſoul and body: And every deſire that ſprings from this root being
ſuffered to go forth, defiles the man, and brings in that which
oppreſſeth the Juſt, until by continuance man grow into the nature of the
enmity, and the imaginations of the heart be wholly evil, and that which
ſhould give the knowledge of God wholly buryed, and in many that which
ſhould give the knowledge of ſin alſo, whereby man becomes paſt
feeling, utterly dead in ſins and treſpaſſes heaped upon the juſt
againſt the day of judgement, which becomes by cuſtom as natural to commit
as to the Ox to drink water; yea with greedineſſe doth man in this
condition hunt after his own deſtruction, having damn'd up the way of life in
himſelf by often tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing it, and is become degenerate from the
nature of God, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in, and willingly joyned to that nature of
Satan, which as a leaven hath and doth work into its own nature all that
receive it, or yeild unto it, whom as they grow therein, there ſprings up
fruits of the ſame root and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <pb n="2" facs="tcp:168496:2"/> which they bring forth
in his time and opportunity with liking and delight, being furniſhed with all
ſubtilty to colour them over, and plead for them, being in covenant and
agreement with ſin, ſome in one thing, and ſome in another, every one
pleading the allowance of that ſin with God which moſt ſutes their
luſts, pride, profit or pleaſure, credit or eſteem in the world, or
ſome ſelf-end, and at theſe they take counſel, and not at the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the Lord, which is ſin, and which is no ſin, but none will believe that
they can be ſet free from all ſin by him who teſtifies againſt all
ſin in ſpirit; and in all this the man of ſin hath his kingdom by
conſent, for they being willing to keep covenant with him in one evil, are
guilty of all.</p>
            <p>Now the way to overcome all this, and him that hath his power
therein, is by faith in Chriſt Jeſus the light, and life, and way to the
Father; for without believing there can be no victory; but in the faithful
following of him, and patient bearing his croſſe, and enduring his
ſufferings, comes the enmity to be ſlain, captivity led captive, and man
ſet at liberty in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeed, to ſerve the Father in ſpirit and
life again.</p>
            <p>And firſt, Chriſt as he is the light of the world muſt be
believed, for ſo he comes to manifeſt and reprove the deeds of
darkneſſe, and to make a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the works of God, &amp; the
works of the devil, in the mind &amp; ſpirit of the creature, &amp; to let
them ſee what ſpirit doth exerciſe their minds &amp; affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and the
fruits of each ſpirit, and the moving &amp; working of each ſpirit
ſeverally, without which none can rightly know what is to be deſtroyed, and
what ſaved: what to joyne to, and what to war againſt: for by this light
alone comes man to the knowledge of ſin in himſelf, in the ground and root
of it, and every motion threof: for though the letter or ſomething without,
may ſhew what is ſin by its fruits when it is brought forth, yet its the
work of the ſpirit to diſcover ſpiritual wickedneſs in its firſt
motion, which is the onely place to kill it ere it become ſin; and this light
muſt be believed, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently minded all-along, for ſuch is the
ſubtilty of the enemy, having got power over the will and ſences of man,
that he will ſet them to war againſt the creature, and deſtroy the
Creation rather then that of his which defiles the creature, and this cannot be
avoided any other way but by minding the light of Chriſt, to ſeperate that
which is but to be clenſed, from that which is to be deſtroyed, &amp; this
man cannot do without the ſpirit, being a ſpiritual work, though he never
ſo much ſeeks after it: And here is the cauſe why ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are kept at hard
labour all their time, and never come clear out of ſinne and uncleanneſs,
even not believing in that which hath the power to ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and lead out of
the evil, but without the ſingle eye are at work in the dark, and ſees not
a clear ſeparation in the body: And hence it is that ſome deſtroy
themſelves in ſeeking to deſtroy ſin, not minding the light of the
Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, is led by the deſtroyer, fighting againſt that which Chriſt
comes to ſave, whileſt he that comes to deſtroy lyes hid in the dark: But
he that believes in that which manifeſts all things, reproves all things, and
judges all things, with that eye ſhall be led what to war againſt, and what
to joyne with all-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in the work, for he alone is the covenant of light,
and given for a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which whoſoever believes and follows, ſhall not
erre in judgement or practice, but unbelief therein is the cauſe why there
are ſo many blinde guides, and many people dye in their ſins.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:168496:2"/>And thus he is the way of God, and is to be
believed in, (to wit) as he manifeſts the works of the Devil apart from the
works of God, condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the one in the fleſh, and juſtifying the other in
the ſpirit; and as he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts every ſpirit with its workings, motions,
and ends, their ground and off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, whence they come, and whither they
return, that thereby the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may know who it is that exerciſes his mind
and members, and to what ſpirit he yeelds himſelf in his obedience and
ſervice, and ſo may come to know the uſe and end of all his works, what
to chuſe, and what to refuſe; what to juſtifie, and what to condem in its
firſt motion, before it be brought forth or formed in the womb, that
judgement may be kept on the head of tranſgreſſion, and liberty
proclaimed to the Juſt: and for want of faith and feeling of this way of
Chriſt it is that ſo many periſh in ſin, and yet ſeem to ſtrive
againſt ſin, even becauſe they cannot believe that to be ſufficient to
ſave from ſin which manifeſts ſin in the ground, and condemns it in its
firſt motion, which if they did but in faith joyne with him to condemn ſin
in the ground, temptation, and motion, it would dye, and wither, and not be
able long to live or prevail; and if it for a time ſhould prevail in the
members, yet not to condemnation; for I have found a great difference between
ſin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the creature (though not yet wholly dead) and ſin lived
in, and pleaded for; for if thy life and judgement be in that alone which
condemns ſin, then art thou dead to ſin, and alive to Chriſt, and it is
no more thou that ſins, but ſin that yet remains in thee, to which thou art
dead, to which thou doſt not conſent, like, nor approve of, nor any way add
any ſtrength thereto; but thy faith and love, delight and ſtrength is in
him, which condemns it; he that truly is in this faith and love, by the working
thereof ſhall all his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enmies periſh, and by that faith and love ſhall
the juſt live in that creature, and he in him condemning and killing ſin
till it all be done away, and the creature of God found alive in him alone, who
without ſpot will preſent him to the Father; for this I have found, that,
that which manifeſts ſin in its firſt motion, judges it there, and
condemns it there, hath the onely power to kill ſin ere it be committed, and
ſo hath onely power to ſave from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; for this you ſhall find,
that as Chriſt doth not live to juſtification, where he is not believed and
juſtified, loved, followed, and confeſſed, ſo ſin doth not live to
condemnation where it is hated, condemned, and denyed; for where that ſpirit
of wickedneſs is ſeen in the light, and ſeparated from, and judged apart
from the creature, the creature joyning in judgement with the juſt, there
ſin will wither, and <hi>Satan</hi> flee, for there he hath no kingdom, nor a
hiding <hi>Habitation;</hi> for the light being minded, and judgement having
free paſſage and conſent, it ſearcheth out his hidden things, and
judgement paſſeth upon all his deceit, root and ground, with his fruits;
ſo is the ſtrong man ſpoyled, and his ſtuff, by faith in Chriſt, and
not by ſtrength of the creature, by believing the juſt, and denying the
unjuſt.</p>
            <p>For according to every mans <hi>faith,</hi> ſo ſhall he
receive from God; now he that believes <hi>ſalvation,</hi> and that cleaves
to, and lives in ſome ſin, and pleads for it, and believes he muſt do
ſo, his <hi>faith</hi> ſtands in an unclean thing, and an unclean thing
will live by that <hi>faith,</hi> and be juſtified by that <hi>creature,</hi>
and in his juſtifying any thing that is unclean, therein is the juſt
condemned; and <pb n="4" facs="tcp:168496:3"/> the juſt being condemned which ſhould
give dominion over the <hi>unclean,</hi> the wilde <hi>Plant</hi> hath its
liberty to grow until it overſpread the <hi>Plant</hi> of God, and cover the
man, wholly ſtop the ear, and blind the eye, and hardens the heart againſt
every motion to good, or check for evil; and let not this man look for good
fruit, but after his <hi>faith</hi> who ſo believes.</p>
            <p>Alſo, on the contrary, <hi>He that feels a ſtrife in himſelf
between the clean and the unclean, &amp; ſees the one reprove for ſin, and
the other plead for ſin, and believes in that which is pure, clean and
juſt, which condemns the unjuſt and unclean, that faith ſtands in that
which is pure, and the mysterie of it is held in a pure conſcience; and that
pure faith being followed, will purifie the heart, and clenſe the hands from
unjuſt actions; and by that faith the juſt lives, and grows, and ſprings,
and brings forth, and the pure plant ſpreads and covers the earth with the
knowledge of God, his holineſſe and purity, and all grace in the heart,
which becomes as a working<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaven, till it hath wrought out the unclean nature,
and conformed the whole man to himſelf: And this is a work of the holy faith,
which none can receive but who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves in holineſſe; for none can bring
clean fruit out of an unclean faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this further, for the incouragement of ſuch as honeſtly
indeed would be rid of their ſin, &amp; ſet free to ſerve God in
holineſſe without deceit, thou feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thee the moving of that which is
holy, bearing witneſſe againſt that which is contrary to holineſſe,
&amp; condemning it, and thee for joyning with it in all thy converſation: I
ſay, in that believe, for that is all thou knows of Chriſt in thee, and
believing and following it, thou wilt feel it making a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration in thy
inward man, betwixt that which Chriſt comes to ſave, and that which he
comes to deſtroy; for this is he that comes from above to ſet before thee
life and death divided, that thou joyning to the life, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, may be
ſaved from death; and as thou art faithful to this ſpirit which condemns
ſin in the fleſh, ſo thou wilt feel warring againſt, and working out
ſin daylie, to which if thou clearly joyne, denying that which it condemns,
then art thou one ſpirit with him in his work, and art no longer in the
fleſh, nor to be condemned with that ſin remaining in the fleſh, but art
one in him that condemns ſin and ſelf in ſinning till ſin become
exceeding ſinful in thy eyes, as it is in the eyes of God; and as thou grows
in love and liking with that pure ſpirit, its law and leadings, ſo thou
wilt become dead to the law of ſin, and it will loſe its power in thee, not
being minded, loved and ſerved, thy mind, love and fear being exerciſed in
that which condemns it, and here that faith that works by love takes the
victory, and not thy ſtriving in thy own ſtrength only from a ſight of
ſin by the Law, for by the works of the Law thou canſt not be juſtified,
but by the working of ſaith in Chriſt Jeſus that ſpirit; and as thou
feel his working in thee, and thou one with him therein, in his work thou art
juſtified, and by beholding of him in this faith thou wilt be changed into
his likeneſſe and power by his mighty working in thee, even by that
ſpirit to which thou art turned; and as he grows in thee, and thou in him,
thou wilt feel that power ariſing which will make thee able to anſwer a
good conſcience, and give laſting peace, and ſo by his reſurrection
ſhall be ſaved from condemnation, from which thy own works will not ſave
thee, and this work will go on with joy if thy heart be honeſt; for ſeeing
him that is holy ſet before thee condemning ſin, and his holineſs and
beauty in all his <pb n="5" facs="tcp:168496:3"/> motions doth ſo delight the honeſt
heart, to ſee ſuch a glory and beauty near thee, that it makes the way
eaſie after him for the joy that is ſet before thee for in all thy
tribulations, tryals, and temptations, this faith will preſent him before
thee; and this made the Saints of old endure the croſs, and deſpiſe the
ſhame, and bear the reproach after him joyfully, following the Lamb in all
his leadings.</p>
            <p>So thou that loves holineſs, it is neare thee, power over ſin
and Satan is near thee, ſalvation is at hand; go not forth to ſeek that
abroad which thou haſt loſt in thy own Houſe; he is thy ſalvation that
condemns ſin in thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom: he that reproves the wicked is with thee: he
that is pure is thy peace: he that never conſented to ſin, but ſtands a
witneſſe againſt it, if thou have ſuch a ſpirit in thee, thou haſt
the ſpirit of Chriſt the Saviour: So take heed unto him, to believe him,
and to mind his leading, and to follow him, if thou part not from him he will
be thy everlaſting peace and over-ruling power to ſubdue thy ſins; and by
him ſhalt thou tread down ſtrength with eaſe and delight, and ſhalt be
able to ſay with ſuch as was come to the ſame ſpirit, <hi>Greater is he
that is in thee, then he that is in the world;</hi> and onely that faith that
ſees him hath power to overcome the world, for he that beholds his glory,
treads the worlds glory under his feet; for whatſoever is ſeen in him doth
ſo far exceed all other things, that it takes the mind out of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
delights, and leaves them empty; ſo that things in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and
things in <hi>Earth,</hi> Principalities nor Powers are able to ſeperate from
the love of him, how much more wilt thou leave thy delight in ſin, when thou
comes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in him! his love will conſtrain thee, who loves purely, and
hath found it, for this is joy indeed, and love unſpeakable, when the ſoul
finds that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in his own Houſe freely given, which he hath long been
ſeeking abroad and could never purchaſe neither with life nor eſtate: And
the more thou beholdeſt him, the more will his glory and love appear, for as
thou in the light beholdeſt the pure motion of this Holy One, thou wilt come
to ſee what thou art without him, and what thy wants is, without which thou
canſt not be happy, and that thou canſt not have a laſting peace till
with his vertue thou be filled, and with his glory covered, and with his power
armed againſt every temptation, all which he wil make thee heir of with him,
as thou minds to be faithful, and hearken to his movings to obey them in all
things, who thereby wil lead thee his way by which he obtained all this glory
&amp; pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, &amp; this inheritance from the Father; in which way thou wilt
find a croſs to all thy own wayes, and to the worlds ſpirit in all things,
which will be eaſie if thou keep thy eye ſingle to him who is ſet before
thee therein, his glory, and the gaining thereof; but if thou look back into
the world, thou look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt into temptation without him, and there the ſpirit
of the world preſents thee with loſs, and not with gain, ſetting before
thee what thou muſt forgo, with all the hard ſhips and impoſſibilities
that may be, but no power to bear it, but keeping thy eye to him, thou haſt
alwayes power and peace before thee in thy way, the hope thereof will be as an
Anchor, and the faith a ſhield, and the love will give thee life to undergo
all the tryals for his ſake, bearing his croſs daylie, which muſt part
thee and thy ſins, and crucifie the worldly ſpirit with the luſt thereof,
and kill all that wars againſt thy ſoul, <pb n="6" facs="tcp:168496:4"/> and keeps thee
from thy inheritance; wherefore it is called, <hi>The great power of God unto
ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as thou becomes faithful thereto, thou wilt feel the fruit of
that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly One ſpringing in thee, moving to be brought forth in thee towards
God and man, thy faith will grow, and prayers with ſtrong cryes to the
Father; as the ſpirit ſees thy wants, thy love will ſpring and move in
thee, and bring forth towards God and man upon all occaſions, which if thou
willingly ſerve in its ſmalleſt motion, it will encreaſe, but if thou
quench it in its movings, and refuſe to bring it forth, it will wither and
dry in the not being exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>And it is the like of gentleneſs, meekneſs, patience, and all
other vertues which are of a ſpringing and ſpreading nature, where they are
not quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but ſuffered to come forth to his praiſe in his will and
time, who is the begetter thereof, and to the comfort of his own ſeed, and
croſs to the world: And if thou be faithful daylie to offer up the body as a
ſacrifice, to bring forth his Image, Name, and Power before his Enemies, then
what he moves thee to bring forth ſhall be thy inheritance, and will daylie
encreaſe with u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; but if thou wilt not give up for his Name ſake, but
would hold the treaſure, and eſcape the reproach, then will it be taken
from thee, and given to him who will yeeld the Lord of the Vinyard his fruit in
due ſeaſon; for that which the Father freely begets, he will have freely
brought forth, that the ſhining thereof in the dark world may praiſe him;
what a glory it is to ſee peace ſhine in the midſt of war, love in the
midſt of hatred, meekneſs in the midſt of ſtrife, righteous judgement
in the midſt of wickedneſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency in the midſt of violence, and
oppreſſion, as a Lilly amongſt thorns, ſo is that of God amongſt the
men of the world; and therein doth his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and beauty appear in his Temple,
to which all muſt confeſs, and praiſe him therein: This is the glorious
day which many have talked on, and thoſe onely are the children of it in whom
the brightneſs ſhines forth; that which God begets in thee is his Son,
confeſs him in the midſt of his Enemies, and thereby is the Father
glorified; and his Son crowned: but if thou denyeſt him thy body to
teſtifie againſt the world, he will deny thee his life to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem thee from
the evil of it: the breaking forth of the Sun is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the good
day, when that which ſo long hath condemned thee for ſin, comes to ſhine
forth freely in acts of righteouſneſs, then ſhall thy dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe be
turned into light, thy condemnation into peace, thy ſorrow for ſin, to
rejoice in holineſs: and this will be a good day to thee, even the day of the
Lords righteouſneſs and redemption to thy ſoul, and a witneſs to all
men of the appearance of the juſt one, which teſtimony whoſoever
refuſeth to bear, all his Religion will prove in vain, and conſiſts in
words without power.</p>
            <p>There is a way in which the barren becomes fruitful, and a little
is more ſerviceable to God then he that hath great <hi>Riches</hi> for
himſelf; you that ſees your wants are nigh it, and the lowly mind will
ſooneſt follow it; and for the honeſt hearted it is prepared, who ſeeks
to ſerve God, and not your ſelves. If you take heed to your own wayes, and
make nothing in your minds, you <pb n="7" facs="tcp:168496:4"/> muſt not create that which
muſt ſtand before God, for he wil be ſerved with his own begettings in
you. Take heed therefore you make nothing to your ſelves, nor murther that
which he freely begets; but let your minds be alwayes hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, waiting with
patience in that which lets you ſee your wants, therewith that your hearts
may be open always upward towards God the father of every good gift; and you
being hid in the Heavenly mind from the nature which compaſſeth the Earth
in its comprehenſions, and would compaſſe Heaven alſo, and waiting in a
croſs to that mind, as you come into the patient ſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, you muſt
feel the begettings of the Father moving in you to be brought forth, to which
you muſt become ſervants, ſetting aſide all ſubtilty, and that which
is haſty, &amp; what ever is your own, or hath an end to your ſelves, and
in the pure mind behold what way this moves its appearance againſt the
worldly ſpirit, that with your whole hearts and might you may bring it forth
in its own image, without reaſoning or conſulting with any thing of your
own, or any thing of this world, for this ariſes in a contrary nature to that
which is one with the world, bears another image and fruit, and hath ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
glory in its appearance, in which the Father alone is glorified, even in this
his Son of his own free begetting; and herein is the Father glorified, that he
be brought forth with his fruits into the world, who thereby is known how far
he is above and contrary to the worldly ſpirit, both in the ground, root, and
off-ſpring.</p>
            <p>And whoſoever will give up themſelves to ſerve him herein by
his encreaſe, ſhall become rich towards God, and encreaſe in ſtrength
daylie againſt the world; and by bringing forth, and by his beauty in
holineſs, ſhall become glorious and beloved in the ſight of the Father,
whoſe image and beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting they bear, wherein they ſhall become Heirs of
the eternal glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But if you look into the earthly mind, there the worldly
ſpirit meets you with his counſel, and conſulting and reaſoning
therewith, you take counſel in the night, from which the counſel of God is
hid, his work, the end &amp; glory thereof, and instead of that you will be
preſented with the pleaſure, and glory of this world, which stands in
vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things, and is pleaſing to the viſible eye and ſences, which
glory the god of this world ſees into, and leads into, in which his wiſdom
and knowledge ſtands, which cannot enter into the inviſible glory and
treaſure: And in this ſpirit that knows not God, nor his works, nor ſeeks
his glory, will you meet with the thief and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, ſons of
darkneſſe, who will perſwade you ſtrongly to murther the pure motion,
and not to bring it forth, or elſe ſo to bring it forth as that the image
thereof may be ſo marred, as not to bear its clear and perfect teſtimony
againſt the worlds King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Power and Glory, and this you cannot avoid if
you look back into his counſel, and counſel with your own reaſonings,
wherein ariſes thoughts, cares and pleaſures out of the world, which
cumbers the mind, checks the ſeed, and kills the holy childe, and covers the
Pearl with earthly affections and lusts, which continually hardens the heart,
and ſtrengthens the will againſt the innocent, and ſo puts the juſt to
death in the womb, for want of bringing forth in its time, and according to its
motion, which when you have rejected, you cannot beget again of your ſelves,
nor in your own wills, though you may procure the like from another ſpirit in
that nature which reſiſts the truth, and corrupts the mind, and brings
forth in its own will, as ſome have done, who having diſobeyed the ſtill
motion of the meek ſpirit, and looking for high things <pb n="8" facs="tcp:168496:5"/> God
hath given them up to a lofty ſpirit, and strong workings in a contrary
nature, who now have a power wherewith to reſiſt that which firſt begot
you out of the world, and a moving ſpirit which draws towards the world
again, which being got into the place of God, (as God) makes them believe that
their return is of the ſame ſpirit that called them out, to which they
yeelding the ſame obedience, thenceforth without fear becomes the ſame they
was, if not ſeven ſold worſe, without all hope of recovery: and this
diſobedience becomes as witchcraft.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore in the fear of God, watch with all diligence, hearken in
the ſimplicity of your hearts, and take heed that you ſlip not any time of
hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, nor prove falſe in your conception or bringing forth, but that
both cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and election may be made ſure to you, not only by being in the
know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, but alſo by bringing it ſorrh, that it may be your own
for ever: for that which you bring forth is your inheritance, and none can take
it from you, but you have power therein againſt all contrary ſpirits, which
whileſt it is but in the motion, will ſtrongly tempt and ſeek the life
thereof to ſtifle: but being brought forth, it is before you, and only ſo
it is put on as a breſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate, and becomes a defence, which being begot, and
not brought forth, it withers, and becomes as dry bones in the womb.</p>
            <p>Therefore as you muſt give your minds wholly to hearken, ſo
muſt you give your ſtrength wholly to obey: and when you feel the pure to
move in you, with your whole ſtrength ſerve it, and bring it forth, give up
your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes a ſacrifice for his ſake whom you have not ſeen, that his
life may be made manifeſt in your mortal fleſh, and through you in the
world, that he may be ſeen in his brightneſs to you that love him, and
before his Enemies, then is the body for the Lord, and not for fornication: But
if you reſt in the knowledge of this myſterie, and bring not forth to life,
with that knowledge you commit fornication, and teach others to commit
fornication alſo; this knowledge in the diſobedient mind becomes the mother
of Harlots, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications of the earth, with which the Kings of the earth
are deceived, but none ever joyned to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For it is not the hearing of the truth that purifies the
ſoul, but the obedience of truth which makes the Veſſel fit for the
Maſters uſe, who in his uſing, and its obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence makes it a veſſel
of honor, and glorifies his Son therein, in a body prepared to do the Fathers
will in the world, whereby the Father is glorified in the Son, in whom he
shines forth in the clear image as the Father begets him again in you, and you
in him, which was in him before the world was, of his own nature and good will,
which as you receive again by faith and obedience, you will be changed into the
ſame image and nature, and to delight onely therein, being born of the ſame
ſpirit, as he that is born of the flesh delights in the things of the
fleſh.</hi>
